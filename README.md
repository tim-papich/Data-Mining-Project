This repository contains our project on New York City taxi services in the wake of Covid-19. The entirety of our analysis is done using Python with various supporting libraries. The code is broken up into several smaller notebooks for ease of understanding. The final report and presentation are also included. Hope you enjoy!

### Abstract

This paper assesses the impact of COVID-19 and various lockdown measures on taxi and ride-sharing services in New York City. The consequences of the pandemic for customer habits and the economics of the industry are evaluated across data from millions of taxi rides between 2019 and 2020. Passenger volume, trip duration, tip percentages, and a host of other metrics are explored in this multidimensional approach. While this analysis is performed primarily through the lens of COVID-19, general trends such as monthly revenue, average traffic congestion by time and location, and the increasing influence of ride-sharing services on the cityâ€™s traditional medallion system are also investigated. The authors conclude that as a result of the pandemic (1) ridership decreased abruptly resulting in massive shortfalls, (2) overall volatility in all ride-related attributes increased, (3) customers  began choosing to take longer trips to more remote locations, (4) tipping behavior became less predictable, (5) airport taxi traffic decreased significantly and became an accurate predictor for flight passenger volume.
